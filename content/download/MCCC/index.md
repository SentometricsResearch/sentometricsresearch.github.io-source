The first data set is based on a corpus of 8 newspapers. It reflects the initial 2020 NBB research paper version available at: [https://www.nbb.be/doc/ts/publications/wp/wp395en.pdf](Ardia, D., Bluteau, K., Boudt, K. & Inghelbrecht, K. (2020). Climate change concerns and the performance of green versus brown stocks. National Bank of Belgium, Working Paper Research, October 2020 No 395.)

The second data set is based on a corpus of 10 newspapers and 2 newswires. It reflects the updated 2022 research paper version available at: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3717722](Ardia, D., Bluteau, K., Boudt, K. & Inghelbrecht, K. (2022). Climate change concerns and the performance of green versus brown stocks. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3717722). We note that not only the corpus is updated in this version, but also the topics. Moreover, monthly indices are added to the dataset to complement the daily indices.
