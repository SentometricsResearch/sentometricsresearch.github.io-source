Within the growing and fascinating landscape at the frontier of text mining, sentiment analysis, and econometrics, the field **sentometrics** has emerged. Researchers in sentometrics investigate the transformation of qualitative sentiment embedded in textual data (and other alternative data sources) into quantitative sentiment variables, and their subsequent application in an econometric analysis of the relationships between sentiment and other variables.

Many researchers steer forward sentometrics by doing tremendous work across the domains of economics, finance, politics and beyond. The objective of this hub is to provide resources and open-source software to help the community of these researchers interact with each other and showcase their work, while also introducing those interested to enter the field.

This [survey paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/joes.12370) and the R package [sentometrics](https://sentometricsresearch.github.io/sentometrics) are perfect starting points to dive into this exciting field.
