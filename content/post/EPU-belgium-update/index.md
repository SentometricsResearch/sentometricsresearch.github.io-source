title: Update to the Belgian (french and dutch) EPU Index
---

We have made an update to the Belgian Economic Policy Uncertainty index.

This update makes it that the index is much more localized to Belgium and thus less affected by international events (that have no impact on Belgium). Moreover, we have made some changes that take into account some specificity of the dutch language. 

Overall, this results into a more aligned and correlated french and dutch specific EPU index. This update also eliminates unwarranted disparities between the EPU index of each language.
