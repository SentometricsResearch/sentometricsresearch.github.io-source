title: The R package sentometrics
---

The **sentometrics** package offers an integrated framework for textual sentiment time series aggregation and prediction. It accounts for the intrinsic challenge that textual sentiment can be computed in many different ways, as well as the large number of possibilities to pool sentiment into a time series index. The package integrates the fast quantification of sentiment from texts, the aggregation into different sentiment time series, and the prediction based on these measures. All in one coherent workflow!
