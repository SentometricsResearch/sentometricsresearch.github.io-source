title: Introducing the sentometrics field
---

The advent of massive amounts of textual, audio, and visual data has spurred the
development of econometric methodology to transform qualitative sentiment data into quantitative
sentiment variables, and to use those variables in an econometric analysis of the relationships between sentiment and other variables. This emerging research field is referred to as sentometrics, which is a portmanteau of sentiment (analysis) and econometrics.
