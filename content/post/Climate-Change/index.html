<p>Many consider climate change as one of the biggest challenges of our times. However,
there is disagreement on the magnitude of the climate change problem and how to solve it.
Conditional on their view on the issue, some people may have high preferences for sustain-
able solutions and investments tackling the climate change problem, while others may not.
Moreover, these preferences can evolve on the arrival of new information. In general, preferences
about sustainable solutions is laregly a function of how concerned people are about cliamte change.</p>
<p>Being able to observe concerns about climate change in almost in real-time can be useful for many application,
and in particular regarding the pricing of assets. In fact, the model of Pastor et al. (2020) implies that the return
of green stocks vs. the returns of brown stocks is a function of unexpected increase in climate change concerns. In
particular, when there is an unexpeceted increase about cliamte change, green stocks outperforms brown stocks.</p>
<p>An issue however is that climate change concerns is latent, and thus need to be proxied. We present here and index derived
from major U.S newspaper that proxy for unexpected increase in climate change concerns. Our corpus to derive this index is divided in
multiple topics and theme, for which the most reprentative words are shown below:</p>

<p>Moreover, we provide here an interactive graph to explore the overall and topical climate change concerns indices dynamics. In particular, we report the monthly 30-day moving average.</p>
