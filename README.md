To see the website locally, run `blogdown::serve_site()`. Set `options(blogdown.generator.server = TRUE)` with the package **`processx`** to avoid slow automatic website reloading.

### IDEAS

- make posts commentable (set Comments section in the config `params.toml` file)
- redefine and assign in initial papers file `papers_overview.xlsx` useful types (now all as 'Journal article') and tags

### USEFUL

- free images to add with posts (e.g. https://pixabay.com)
